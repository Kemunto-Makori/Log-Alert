# logeye
Logeye will enable monitoring and detection of illegal logging at a great distance.  Microphones and Raspberry Pis mounted in protected forested reserves will listen for certain sounds that are associated with illegal logging, like the sound of a chainsaw or a large vehicle in an unauthorized area, alert authorities in real-time for them to stop illegal activity in its tracks.

The logeyerfmodel:
A random forest classification model that uses the ESC dataset (a freely available Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license) to classify sounds relating to chainsaws, handsaws, engines, crackling fires and car horns.
